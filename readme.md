AI agents are the programs where LLM output control the workflow.
AI solution that consist of any or all of thisis an example of agentic ai :-
1. Multiple LLM calls
2. LLM with the ability to use tools.
3. Environment where LLm intracts.
4. A planner to cordinate activities
5. atonomy - where agent can decide the order

Two types of agentic ai systems:-
1. Workflows - where Code is used to orchestrate LLMs and TOOLs
2. Agents - are system where LLMs dynamically uses tools and processes to accomplish things.
