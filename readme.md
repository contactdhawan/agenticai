AI agents are the programs where LLM output control the workflow.
AI solution that consist of any or all of thisis an example of agentic ai :-
1. Multiple LLM calls
2. LLM with the ability to use tools.
3. Environment where LLm intracts.
4. A planner to cordinate activities
5. atonomy - where agent can decide the order

Two types of agentic ai systems:-
1. Workflows - where Code is used to orchestrate LLMs and TOOLs
2. Agents - are system where LLMs dynamically uses tools and processes to accomplish things.

Different types of design patterns :-
1. Prompting :- where one LLM make calls to another and you can you your code also drive the result.
2. Routing :- You have a router and then that router will make use of different LLMs based on requirement.
3. Parallelization :- Here you write a code that divide the task into multiple tasks to process in parallel by different LLMs and the a aggregator code merge them into one.
4. Orchestrator-Worker :- You use a LLM that divide a complex task into multiple tasks and then use another LLM to aggregate these tasks into one output.
5.
